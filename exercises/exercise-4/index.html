        <p>
            The Ballad of the Bronze Serpent is a homebrew TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying 
            Game) campaign that I am running for my friends. It is set in the storied
            land of Shaiyah, populated by sapient animals gifted with strange powers.

        </p>
        <p>
            The once great kingdom of Shaiyah has been devastated by a brutal civil war 
            caused by a feud resulting in the king being overthrown by his envious 
            brother. The Rebel King reigned with an iron fist but did not last long, as 
            he would eventually succumb to an unknown illness, leaving no heir to assume 
            the throne. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For two generations now, the land has been without a king. Disorder reigns as 
            villages and tribes vy for power. But as pestilence begins to spread, so to does
            word of an ancient relic with the power to heal any ailment. Hundreds flock to
            the small town of Ashzakhar in search of the panacea that resides there.
