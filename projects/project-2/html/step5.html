          <p>
            Now onto the rending, which comes in two parts: light and shadow.
            First, establish a lighting direction with an arrow. This will help
            us determine where to place our highlights and shadows. These
            elements will serve to describe the form or volume of the character.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my illustrations, I use a dark blue or violet on a multiply
            layer for the shadows, and a bright yellow on a screen layer for the
            highlights. Lower the opacity of each to your liking, so that the
            colors blend nicely. Shadows tend to be cooler in color, while
            highlights tend to be warmed in color, however, it is important to
            note that the shadow usually is the opposite hue of the light being
            cast. For example, if the light were red, then the shadow would have
            a greenish hue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this step, I sometimes find it helpful to create a layer of gray
            over the other colors, which will help me to focus on just the
            lighting. If it reads well on just gray, it will read well with your
            flat colors. Consider how light would realistically interact with
            your character in a three dimensional space. Shadows usually come in
            two varieties: form shadow and cast shadow. A form shadow occurs
            around an object on its side opposite the light, like the dark side
            of the moon or, in this case, underneath Amos' tail. A cast shadow
            is what happens when an object is blocking the light from reaching
            another surface, like the moon casting a shadow on the earth during
            a solar eclipse or, in this case, the shadow cast on Amos' side by
            his cloak.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to be extra fancy, you can include a bounce light in the
            shadow, which can add a lot of life to your piece. In real life, a
            bounce light occurs when light is being reflected off of a different
            surface onto your subject. For this example, I used cyan as the
            color of my bounce light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also consider the material that the light is being cast onto. Shiny
            objects made of metal or certain fabrics will tend to produce
            harsher highlights. The metal button on Amos' cloak is a good
            example. The eyes are also highly reflective, however, I will
            typically color the irises on a separate layer to get the exact
            colors that I want, making them appear more lively.
