            <h2>Turkey Dog</h2>
            <p>
                Behold the glorious being known as Turkey Dog. 
                Most festive of all creatures. Most based of all 
                memes. Conqueror of cringe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Born a dog and raised by wild turkeys, Turkey Dog
                traveled the world in search of meaning. Is he a 
                turkey or a dog? Who's to say? Turkey Dog didn't 
                know the answer. He traversed mountains and valleys 
                seeking answers and querying wise sages from all over. 
                But their answers made no sense to Turkey Dog, so 
                he continued searching. He fought huge monsters and 
                powerful aliens, but these challenges were too easy 
                for him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, he found his true calling: correcting 
                idiotic takes on the internet. Convincing people on 
                the web that they're wrong? Now that was a challenge 
                worthy of the great Turkey Dog.
