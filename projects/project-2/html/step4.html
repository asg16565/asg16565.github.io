          <h1>Step 4: <strong>Flat Colors</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Next are the flat colors. These will be the “base” colors of your
            character before we get to the highlights and shadows. Consider the
            color scheme of your character. Amos' main colors are reddish-orange
            and navy blue, and accent colors include green and yellow. This is
            an example of a split complementary color scheme, which includes
            colors that are close in hue in addition to a color that is opposite
            in hue. Other color schemes include monochromatic, analogous,
            complementary, triadic, and tetradic. Consider color theory and what
            kind of emotions those colors evoke in someone looking at your
            character. For example, the blue in Amos' cloak is often associated
            with trustworthiness, loyalty, and wisdom, good traits for a
            protagonist like Amos to have or aspire to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also consider contrast. Does your character design have a good
            variety of light and dark values? If the colors seem like they are
            blending together, you can use a saturation filter to make
            everything black and white. If they are practically the same shade
            of gray when viewed this way, consider making one darker and the
            other lighter.
