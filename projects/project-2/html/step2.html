          <p>
            During this phase, we will refine what we have made in the previous
            step in preparation for the line art phase. Simply reduce the
            opacity of the previous layer and create a new layer for the sketch.
            It is in this step that we can begin drawing an outfit for the
            character, too. We draw the body first, because that will inform how
            we draw clothing. For example, the fabric of Amos' cloak will curve
            around his arm at the elbow and drape down from there. This is also
            an area of tension, meaning that the fabric will overlap here. The
            topic of clothing folds could easily be its own tutorial, so I will
            not elaborate much further there. Again, I would recommend using
            photo reference for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage, we can be more detailed, defining more elements like
            facial features, digits, hair/fur, patterns, accessories, and the
            like. You can allow yourself to draw loosely here, as the details
            will be further refined in the line art stage.
