          <p>
            With everything that I have done so far, I could easily call this
            piece complete, however, there are a few extra things that we can do
            to spice up our illustration. You could, for example, color the
            lines, so that they are not just one flat color. Consider creating a
            simple drop shadow to define your character in space. Another thing
            that I like to do is overlay a paper texture over everything using a
            multiply layer. Such textures that are free to use can easily be
            found online. Sometimes, I even like to create a simple and abstract
            background element to frame the character. And if you so desire, you
            can finish with a signature.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is how I would illustrate a character, but it is by no means
            the only way. Different artists have their personalized techniques.
            You may want to go simpler or more detailed, more cartoony or more
            realistic. It really depends on what you want to draw. But I hope
            that you found this demonstration useful. Thank you.
