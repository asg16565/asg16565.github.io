        <h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        <h2>Session 1: Stolen Relic</h2>
        <p>
            The party members arrive at Ashzakhar and find that the relic 
            has been stolen in the night. They volunteer to investigate 
            and receive a request from Asa the stork physician to retrieve 
            vital ingredients for medicine to treat the afflicted pilgrims 
            seeking the relic.
        </p>
        <h2>Session 2: The Brood</h2>
        <p>
            The party adventures into the forest outside of Ashzakhar in 
            order to find the ingredients that Asa needs. They find the 
            first two ingredients without significant trouble, but the 
            final ingredient that they need is being seized by insects 
            from a hostile faction known as the Brood of Aculeus. The 
            party engages them in combat. It is a close fight, but the 
            party is outmatched and knocked out. 
        </p>
        <h2>Session 3: Rabid Rescue</h2>
        <p>
            The party follows the river back to Ashzakhar, receives aid from 
            Asa, and are able to rest for the night. In the morning, they 
            receive an item from Asa that will help them track down the relic. 
            They make preparations for their journey to the city of Bethselah, 
            the devastated former capital and a den of theives, but they are 
            distracted by an incident in town. 
            A young bat has contracted rabies, and the party springs into 
            action to save the younger brother bat, who is trapped inside 
            their home. They manage to save the child and safely restrain the 
            rabid young bat, who is taken into custody by the town guard until 
            the relic can be recovered to cure him. 
        </p>
        <h2>Session 4: Bucket Thief</h2>
        <p>The next day, the party begins their trek through the mountains 
            toward Bethselah. Along the way, they meet a mountain goat lady 
            who has lost her bucket in a deep, dark well. It is the only way 
            she can get water for her family, so the party offers to help. 
            Ezra, being the party's best swimmer, is lowered down to investigate. 
            In the well, he encounters a faceless amphibian, known as an olm, 
            who has decided to make the bucket his own. The olm fiercely defends 
            his find using his electricity powers, but when Ezra manages to swipe 
            the bucket back, the party is able to force the olm to negotiate. In 
            order to ensure that the bucket will not get stolen again, Zoloto 
            fashions a gold bell for him. Delighted by the sound it makes, the 
            olm accepts the offer, promising not to steal the bucket again. As 
            thanks, the mountain goat lady allows the party to stay at her home 
            for the night.
