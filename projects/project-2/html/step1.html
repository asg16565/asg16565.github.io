          <p>
            This is Amos, a timid, young fox with great concern for his friends.
            He wears a navy blue cloak and carries with him a simple wooden
            staff. Why tell you this? To give context that is necessary to
            understand the character. Character illustration is not just about
            appearance but also personality, which can be conveyed through
            expression, pose, colors, and even shapes. Keep this in mind as you
            draw.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin this new illustration, I drew a triangle, which I will use
            to guide the drawing process. This is by no means necessary but
            makes for a satisfying composition. Next is the actual pose.
            Reference imagery is highly recommended here. Find images online or
            take a picture of yourself in the mirror of the pose you want. Begin
            by drawing a simple “C” or “S” curve. This will be your line of
            action. By aligning the pose with this curve, you can ensure that it
            will appear more dynamic, not stiff.
          </p>

            Then, we have the skeleton, which, for our purposes, can be
            simplified. There are three major elements that we will begin with:
            the head, ribcage, and pelvis. The first can be simplified as a
            circle, while the latter two can be represented by boxes. These are
            the rigid elements around which we can build other parts of the
            body. Joints in the limbs can be represented by circles, which are
            then connected by lines defining the arms and legs. This character
            also has a tail, which is an extension of the spine. In this sketch,
            I also used contour lines to define the form of the tail. It is also
            important to keep things simple at this stage, which allows us to
            focus on the bigger picture before we get to the finer details.
